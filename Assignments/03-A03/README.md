### The cases
#### If the node does not exist return null
#### If the node has no child nodes or 1 child node on the right: return the child to the right (null if none)
#### If the node has one child to the left: return the node to the left
#### If the node has a child on the left and the right: return the smallest value from the right child's branch (requires a function to determine what that value is.)
